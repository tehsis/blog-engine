Let me explain. If I have to say what is the tool that as a programmer I use every single day it would be a text editor. Now, as a programmer I have some other skills that allows me to optimize a lot of tasks I do everyday. Last but not least, what if I want to test out my knowledge in real life? e.g. Let's say that I've just learned how to use Vue.js, right? What if I want to test it in a real environment? Exactly, it wouldn't make any sense to create proof of concepts, instead of really doing it."}},{"template":"basic-template","fields":{"subtitle":"Basic Usage","text":"1.
